#Install Homebrew

1. Go to this link: [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and follow their instructions. **OR** just type the following command (obviously without the "$") into the terminal (last updated 1/9/17):
```terminal
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
